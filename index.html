            <h4>Why is Lucki great?</h4>
            <p>Lucki will forever be my top 1 artist. I have only known him for 3 years, listening to him on and off. But when you truly listen to his lyrics you understand he is secretly a lyrical GENIUS. In his song sessions he says 'My brother just another me' which connects with Aristole who said 'A friend is a second self'. I have dedicated lots of hours into listening to his albums, I have even created a playlist of many of my favorite songs.

            <h4>Why is drake THE goat?</h4>
            <p>Drake is my sassy king. He is the og, he has carried 2016 and so much more. People say old drake better old drake is the best. I honestly agree but the newer albums still GREAT. I remember being a lil kid bumping to the take care album. MARVINS ROOM? How can a song be so sad and still go so HARD. I also made a playlist for him.

            <h4>Abel THAT DUDE</h4>
            <p>
                Abel Abel Abel.. Why is he the so darn COOL. I was 7 listening to the hills on lop on my moms ipod. 90+ HOURS Listened to him and thats only on spotify. Trilogy,House of Balloons, Thursday, Echoes Of Silence, Kiss Land, etc. It goes on and on, he NEVER misses. You guys can call him toxic but thats what brings the fans IN. He is actually sending out hits after hits. DONT even get me started on his stage presence, his song switches; he is just that GUY. He makes sad music, HYPE music, and even some other typa songs iykwim. Let me just hand over my playlist at this point to show you he really is THAT guy.
